## 1. Site Overview

This is the official website for **Škola Bend**, an energetic alternative rock/punk band hailing from Zagreb, Croatia. The site offers fans and event organizers an easy way to explore the band's story, enjoy a gallery of live performances, and get in touch through a simple contact form. Designed with a modern, accessible, and fully responsive layout, the website ensures a seamless experience on any device.

![Responsive Look Reference](docs/responsive-look.png)

The inspiration for this project came from a close friend who is part of Škola Bend, alongside family and friends—people I know well and have watched grow together through music. For the past three years, they've been passionately playing and honing their sound. Over the last year, they've taken the stage at local pubs, bars, and small festivals, even opening for well-known acts. Earlier this year, they released their debut single, **"Ova Pjesma"** ("This Song"), marking an exciting milestone in their journey.

As their presence in the Croatian music scene quickly grows, they needed an official online hub where fans, friends, and event organizers could easily find reliable information. Since they're still emerging artists, the site focuses on essential content rather than extensive features like merchandise or tour dates. The goal was to create a bold, edgy punk vibe that resonates with their audience, informs newcomers about their music, and provides a direct point of contact for booking future gigs and events.

## 3. Site Aims

### Main Objective

To create an official website for the band that showcases their music and style, while providing an easy way for fans and event organizers to get in touch for bookings and inquiries.

---

### Supporting Objectives

## 5. Color Scheme

When designing the color scheme, I wanted to create a bold, punk-inspired appearance that reflects the band's energetic and rebellious spirit. For this reason, I selected a palette of deep blacks, bright whites, and striking reds to deliver maximum contrast and visual impact. I used the following color grid, created on https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/, to check contrast scores and ensure all text remains highly visible and the site is accessible to everyone. This approach guarantees that the design is not only visually powerful but also meets accessibility standards.

![Colour Palette Reference](docs/colour-palette.png)

- **Background:** Black (`#000`)
- **Primary Text:** White (`#fff`)
- **Accent Color:** Red (`#ff0000`)
- **UI Elements:** Charcoal (`#222`)
- **Hover States:** Inverted to white with underlines for clear feedback

The overall color scheme delivers a gritty, high-contrast punk aesthetic while maintaining excellent readability and accessibility.

---

### Navigation Bar

- **Desktop Navigation:**  
  Horizontal menu bar with clear section labels (`About`, `Gallery`, `Contact`)  

- **Mobile Navigation:**  
  Collapsible hamburger menu for optimal mobile experience  

- **Active States:**  
  Current page highlighted in **white** with underline and a red border for clear, high-contrast navigation feedback

  Fully keyboard-navigable with visible focus indicators  

- **Styling:**  
  Dark charcoal background (`#222`) with white text, consistent across all pages  

---

### Anchor Tags (Within All Pages Main Content)

- **Smooth Scrolling:** Implemented for internal page navigation  
- **Accessibility:** All links include descriptive text, proper focus states, and use `aria-label` for social/external links. Navigation links use `aria-current="page"` for the active page, and `tabindex="-1"`/`aria-disabled="true"` for the current/disabled nav link.  
- **Visual Feedback:** Red hover states and underlines provide clear interaction cues  
- **External Links:** Open in a new tab with `target="_blank"` and use `aria-label` for clarity. (Note: `rel` attributes are recommended for security, but not currently present. See [Future Enhancements](#9-future-enhancements).)

---

### Footer

- **Consistent Design:** Matches navigation bar with a dark charcoal background  
- **Social Media Links:** Font Awesome icons for Instagram, YouTube, and other platforms  
- **Accessibility:** Includes ARIA labels and screen reader support  
- **Responsive Layout:** Right-aligned on desktop, centered on mobile devices  
- **Interactive States:** Red hover effects on social icons for visual feedback  

---

### Typography

- **Primary Font:** `SpecialElite` — a vintage, typewriter-style font reflecting the punk aesthetic  
- **Font Loading:** Self-hosted via `@font-face` for optimal performance and reliability  
- **Fallback Fonts:** Clean sans-serif stack for accessibility and broad compatibility  

#### Hierarchy

- **Headings:** Most headings use the `SpecialElite` font, but not all have `2px` letter spacing for emphasis. Some headings use additional Bootstrap classes for size/weight, so appearance may vary slightly between pages.
- **Body Text:** `1.1rem` font size with `1.6` line height and `SpecialElite` font for comfortable reading, consistent across all pages.
- **Navigation:** Uses `SpecialElite` for brand consistency throughout the site.

#### Accessibility Features & Known Limitations

- **Semantic HTML:** All pages use semantic elements (e.g., <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, <footer>) for clear structure and improved accessibility.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** All navigation, forms, and interactive elements are fully accessible via keyboard, with visible focus indicators.
- **ARIA Attributes:** ARIA labels and roles are used where necessary to enhance screen reader support and clarify navigation or social links.
- **Color Contrast:** High-contrast color scheme ensures readability for users with visual impairments.
- **Alt Text:** All images include descriptive alt text for screen readers.
- **Form Accessibility:** All form fields are properly labeled and accessible, with robust autofill CSS. Note: When browser autofill options are displayed (e.g., Chrome's dropdown), the font may temporarily revert to the browser default. Once an option is selected, the custom font is restored. This is a browser-level limitation.
- **Heading Structure:** Each page uses a single <h1> and follows a logical heading order. Some headings are placed within <article> or <section> elements for semantic clarity; automated validators may still issue warnings, but these do not impact accessibility.
- **Known Limitations:**
  - Some automated tools (e.g., W3C Validator, Lighthouse) may flag informational warnings about heading order or section headings due to the use of semantic elements. These are intentional for code clarity and do not affect user experience or accessibility.
  - External links open in a new tab for usability, but currently lack rel attributes for security (see Future Enhancements).
  - Social media and YouTube embeds rely on third-party scripts, which may trigger minor accessibility or performance warnings that cannot be fully resolved from the codebase.

## 10. Testing Phase

For all general bugs, fixes, and detailed results—including Lighthouse scores, WAVE evaluation tool results, and W3C markup validation—please refer to [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

---

## 11. Additional Notes

1. **Code Institute Template Files:**
   - This project was initially created using a template from Code Institute, which includes files such as `.vscode`, `gitpod.dockerfile`, and `.gitpod.yml`. These files are visible in the GitHub repository but do not appear in the local VS Code workspace, making them inaccessible for deletion through the editor. For future projects using similar templates, I will utilize a `.gitignore` file to exclude any unnecessary files from version control and the repository.

2. **Contact Form Functionality:**
   - The contact form on the site is currently a mockup and does not send messages. If the band decides to use the website for official purposes, I can integrate the form with their preferred email address using a third-party form service or another method of receiving inquiries and messages, ensuring seamless communication.
