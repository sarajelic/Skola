# Testing & Known Issues

## Lighthouse & Evaluation Tool Warnings: Documentation

Below is a summary of all major errors and warnings encountered during development, including both those that were fixed and those that are unfixable due to third-party or hosting limitations. For details on fixes and design decisions, see the README.

### 1. Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy
- **Status:** Unfixable (hosting limitation)
- **Description:** Static assets (fonts, images, CSS) are served with a short cache TTL (10 minutes) on GitHub Pages.
- **Reason:** GitHub Pages does not allow custom cache headers. This cannot be changed from your codebase.
- **How to Fix:** Use a custom server or CDN where you can set cache headers for static files. Not possible on default GitHub Pages.

### 2. Does not use passive listeners to improve scrolling performance
- **Status:** Unfixable (third-party)
- **Description:** The embedded YouTube video uses non-passive event listeners, which may affect scroll performance.
- **Reason:** This is caused by YouTube's own JavaScript (www.youtube-nocookie.com). You cannot modify third-party scripts.
- **How to Fix:** Not possible unless YouTube updates their embed code. Removing the YouTube embed would remove the warning, but is not recommended if you want to keep the video.

### 3. Ensure text remains visible during webfont load
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Description:** Lighthouse recommends using `font-display: swap;` for webfonts to avoid invisible text during load.
- **Action:** Added `font-display: swap;` to the `@font-face` rule for the SpecialElite font in CSS. (See `assets/css/styles.css`)

### 4. Contrast, navigation, and accessibility issues
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Description:** Issues included low contrast on buttons/inputs, redundant nav links, heading order, and missing ARIA labels.
- **Action:** Improved color contrast, updated navbars for correct active/current logic, fixed heading levels, and added ARIA labels. (See HTML and CSS files)

### 5. Unoptimized images and LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Description:** Lighthouse flagged large images and slow LCP.
- **Action:** Compressed and resized images, added explicit width/height and preload for the logo, and used WebP format for gallery images. (See `assets/images/` and HTML)

### 6. Unused CSS/JS
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Description:** Lighthouse flagged unused CSS/JS.
- **Action:** Removed all unused CSS and JavaScript. No custom JS is used; Bootstrap JS is loaded via CDN only as needed.

### 7. Form autofill font fallback
- **Status:** Fixed (as much as possible)
- **Description:** Browsers may show default font during autofill suggestion hover.
- **Action:** Added robust autofill CSS to ensure custom font is used after selection. (See README for browser limitation note)

### 8. Redundant/empty elements (e.g., figcaption, visually hidden spans)
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Description:** Gallery and social links had redundant or empty elements for accessibility.
- **Action:** Removed unnecessary elements, kept only descriptive alt text and ARIA labels.

### 9. Image elements do not have explicit width and height (CLS)
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Description:** Lighthouse flagged that some images (e.g., the Å kola logo) did not have explicit width and height attributes, which can cause layout shifts and affect Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) scores.
- **Action:** Explicit `width` and `height` attributes were added to all key images, including the logo and gallery images, in the HTML files. This ensures layout stability and optimal CLS. (See `index.html`, `gallery.html`, and other HTML files)

## Lighthouse: Reduce unused CSS (Bootstrap, Font Awesome)

**Warning:**
Lighthouse flags that Bootstrap and Font Awesome CSS (loaded from CDN) include a large amount of unused CSS, suggesting a potential savings of ~44 KiB.

**Why this is not a problem:**
- These are third-party libraries designed to be general-purpose and include many styles for features not used on this site.
- The site loads these stylesheets non-blocking (`media="print"`/`onload`), so they do not delay rendering or affect performance for users.
- Removing unused CSS from CDN versions is not possible without self-hosting and customizing the libraries, which is not practical for most static sites.
- The warning is informational and does not impact accessibility, usability, or real-world performance for visitors.

**Conclusion:**
No action is needed. The site is already optimized for best-practice loading of third-party CSS. This warning can be safely ignored for this project.

---

**Summary:**
- All actionable performance, accessibility, and best-practice issues in your code have been addressed and fixed.
- The only remaining warnings are caused by third-party services (YouTube) or hosting limitations (GitHub Pages cache policy) and cannot be fixed from your codebase.
- See the README for full details on fixes, design decisions, and accessibility considerations.
